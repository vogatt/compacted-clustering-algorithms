compacted-clustering-algorithms
===============================

Common clustering algorithms implemented very DENSELY in python using functional features such as map, reduce and filter functions.
List comprehensions are heavily used as well.

Currently implemented algorithms include:
- k-means (in around 20 lines of code)
